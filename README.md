# Fornjot

## About

Experimental CAD system. The CAD system is a library, written in the Rust programming language. CAD models are Rust applications that use the library.

The following models are currently available:

- [Cube](https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot/blob/main/models/cube)
- [Spacer](https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot/blob/main/models/spacer)

## Status

Fornjot is still at an experimental stage, where I figure out which approaches work and which don't. It doesn't have enough features to do anything useful.
