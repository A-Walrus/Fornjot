# Fornjot

## About

Experimental CAD system. The CAD system is a library, written in the Rust programming language. CAD models are Rust applications that use the library.

The following models are currently available:

- [Cube](https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot/blob/main/models/cube)
- [Spacer](https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot/blob/main/models/spacer)

## Status

Fornjot is still at an experimental stage, where I figure out which approaches work and which don't. It is capable enough to create very simple models and export those to [3MF] for 3D-printing.

It is very likely that you will run into limits when trying to use Fornjot for anything but the simplest models. If you are missing any functionality, pull requests are very welcome.
