- Add support for exporting models to the 3MF format. This makes it possible to 3D-print Fornjot models.
- Also return surface normal (in addition to distance from surface) when sampling geometry.
- Greatly improve accuracy of the triangle mesh that is generated from models. More room for improvement remains, as sharp edges aren't reproduced faithfully.
