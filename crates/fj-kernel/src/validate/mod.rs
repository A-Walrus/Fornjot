//! Infrastructure for validating shapes
//!
//! Validation enforces various constraints about shapes and the objects that
//! constitute them. These constraints fall into 4 categories:
//!
//! - **Coherence:** Local forms of objects must be consistent with their
//!   canonical forms.
//! - **Geometric:** Comprises various object-specific constraints, for example
//!   edges or faces might not be allowed to intersect.
//! - **Structural:** All other objects that an object references must be part
//!   of the same shape.
//! - **Uniqueness:** Objects within a shape must be unique.
//!
//! Please note that not all of these validation categories are fully
//! implemented, as of this writing.
