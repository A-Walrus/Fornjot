/// API to access a shape's geometry
///
/// Other than topology, geometry doesn't need to be validated. Hence adding
/// geometry is infallible.
///
/// There are several reasons for this:
/// - Geometry doesn't refer to other objects, so structural validation doesn't
///   apply.
/// - There simply no reason that geometry needs to be unique. In addition, it's
///   probably quite hard to rule out generating duplicate geometry. Think about
///   line segment edges that are on identical lines, but are created
///   separately.
/// - Geometric validation doesn't apply either. It simply doesn't matter, if
///   curves or surfaces intersect, for example, as long as they don't do that
///   where an edge or face is defined.
