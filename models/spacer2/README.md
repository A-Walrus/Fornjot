# Fornjot - Spacer 2

A second spacer model that uses a different approach than the first one. While the first spacer builds the model using Constructive Solid Geometry and converts it into a triangle mesh using isosurface extraction from a Signed Distance Field, this second spacer extrudes a rectangular sketch around a surface, and does not use a Signed Distance Field.
