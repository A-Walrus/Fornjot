//! Fornjot modeling library
//!
//! The purpose of this library is to support Fornjot models, which are just
//! Rust libraries. Models depend on this library and use the primitives defined
//! here to define a CAD model.
//!
//! To actually display the CAD model, or export it to another file format, you
//! need the Fornjot app. Please refer to the [Fornjot repository] for usage
//! examples.
